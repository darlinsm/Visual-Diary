                <h3>Courses</h3>
                <p>User Experience for Web Design primarily helped me understand the things people feel and see when
                    they enter a website, and it helped me accommodate the users of my application. Figma for UX Design
                    helped me learn Figma, and use it for the project. UX Research Methods: Interviewing helped me
                    understand my users, and it helped me think about the
                    kinds of questions my users would ask.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>His videos helped inspire me to create interesting and effective designs.</p>

                <p>This helped me hone in my skills as a UI Designer.</p>
                <p>All of these lessons/tutorials really helped me know exactly what I wanted to design before I even
                    created the project in Figma.</p>

                    designs can be exclusive to some.

                <p>My designs included, a genderless persona, more options for race and ethinicity identifications for
                    sign up forms, and a better way to accomodate users with multiple names.</p>

                <p>My sketches have to do with differentiating validated news from user generated news on Twitter. With
                    validated news or breaking news, there would be a star next to the Twitter moment. This would let
                    the user immediately know that the news story has been talked about by news stations. Upon clicking
                    on the Star icon, the user will be presented with only Tweets/reports by certified news outlets.
                    Additionally, every news page would show up allowing the user to try to see bias more clearly.
                    Finally, there could even be a tab that would show where news channels' biases' typically align.
                    That way, the user can try to get a number of opinions and they can form their own opinion. Finally,
                    there is another icon, an X (could be changed to something else) that shows the user that whatever
                    hashtag is trending is user generated. Many times online trolls try to stir up fake news about
                    celebrities (I'm looking at you kpop stans), and it would be helpful for users to know whether
                    something was supported by news media or not.</p>
